# JungleJS
The Jamstack static site framework for Svelte

WARNING: This is an early preview in active development, mostly used for testing different components right now that could become a full framework in the future

Get started:
```
git clone https://github.com/ConProgramming/junglejs.git

cd junglejs && npm install
