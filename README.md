# JungleJS
The Jamstack static site framework for Svelte/Sapper

WARNING: This is an early preview in active development, mostly used for testing different components right now that could become a full framework in the future

Get started:
```
git clone https://github.com/ConProgramming/junglejs.git

cd junglejs/client && npm install && cd ../..
cd junglejs/server && npm install && cd ../..
cd examples/sapper && npm install

npm run dev
```

The app and the graphql playground will now be running on localhost:3000

## Special thanks
 - [littlemooon](https://www.npmjs.com/~littlemooon) for letting me takeover the junglejs package on npm
